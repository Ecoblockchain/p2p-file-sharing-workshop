# 12 - On demand streaming

Most video or audio playing software (like
[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)) have a way to stream
content from an HTTP server using range requests. Let's create a bridge
that exposes our application as an HTTP endpoint.

## Tips

Make sure the bridge supports the HTTP `Range` header.

When an HTTP client wants only part of a file being served by the
server, it can set the `Range` header to indicate which bytes it wants
to fetch:

```
Range: bytes=500-999
```

## Assignment

- Create a priority queue so certain chunks get served first (as they
  are needed when scrubbing)
- Create an HTTP server that bridges the p2p application

## Tests

Share a video file using the server and see if you can play it in VLC by
connecting to the bridge.

## What's next?

If you get this far, here's a few ideas for how to expand your p2p
program:

- Make it work in the browser
- Live streaming
