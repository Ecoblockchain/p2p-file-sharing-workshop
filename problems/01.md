# 1 - Streaming a file.

Write a script that reads its own source code and streams it to stdout.

## Tips

For this task we'll need to use the stream API.

Check out the [`fs.createReadStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_createreadstream_path_options)
to create readable [streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream) from files.

To pipe two or more streams together with error handling included, check out the [pump](https://github.com/mafintosh/pump)
module.

If you are looking for a file to stream out, you can use the source code itself using the `__filename` filename.

## Testing

To test your program, simply run it with node and verify that it outputs its own source code.

```
node reader.js
```
