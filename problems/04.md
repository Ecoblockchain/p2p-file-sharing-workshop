# 4 - Discovering services

Up until now, the client needed to know the address of the server to be able to connect
to it. This is not how p2p systems work. Let's build on the solution for the previous 
exercise, but make the server discoverable and make the client discover it.

## Assignment

Add discoverability to your program so you don't hardcode hostname or port of the server

## Tips

Use [discovery-channel](https://github.com/maxogden/discovery-channel) to add discoverabily to your server and client.

The discovery-channle module uses a combination of the multicast-dns and the Bittorrent DHT to make it possible to both discover and announce peers on your local network and even across the internet.

Server example:

```js
var DC = require('discovery-channel')
var channel = DC()

// Announce that your server is listening on port 3000
// to anyone asking for 'my-channel-id'
channel.join('my-channel-id', 3000)
```

Client example:

```js
var DC = require('discovery-channel')
var channel = DC()

// Ask to be notified of 'my-channel-id' servers
channel.join('my-channel-id')

channel.once('peer', function (id, peer) {
  console.log('Found a new peer:', peer)
})
```

## Testing

To test your solution first run the server.

```
node server.js
```

then the client.

```
node client.js
```

And check that your client successfully finds the server and fetches the file.
