# 8 - Chunking files

All we've done so far is pretty good if we want to share whole files.
What if we want to be able to share just pieces of a file?

Write a TCP server that receives a request with a chunk number and replies
with that specific chunk. The file should be split in 1024 byte chunks. This
TCP server should be started with the channel id and the name of the file to
share.

Also write a client that receives the channel id and chunk number in the command line
then requests said chunk and prints it in the command line.
