# 3 - Streaming a file over TCP.

Let's go a bit more low level and stream files on raw tcp. Write a tcp server that streams
its own source code to whatever client connects to it.

Also, write a client that connects to it and streams the server reply to a file.

## Tips

To create TCP servers we need the [net](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) node core module.

You can create TCP servers like this.

```js

net.createServer(function (socket) {
  pump(someStream(), socket)
});

```

To connect to a running TCP server you will neet the `net.connect` function, which connects to
the server and returns a stream.

```js
var stream = net.connect(3000, 'localhost')
```

To create a writable stream to a file checkout the `fs.createWriteStream` function.

## Testing

To test your solution first run the server.

```
node server
```

then the client.

```
node client
```

And check that a file was created with the content of the servers source code.
