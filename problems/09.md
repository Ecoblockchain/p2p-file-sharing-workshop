# 9 - Chunking and hashing

That seems to work pretty well. But on the problem 8 case, the client has to trust 
that whatever content the server is sending is correct and not compromised. This 
is not how p2p systems work.

Let's build on the solution for problem 8 and add a handshake to it, where the server 
sends a list of hashes to the client, one hash for each chunk. Let's also modify the 
client so that it verifies each chunk as it receives it.
