# 7 - Discovery using hashes.

As we know, hashes can be used to summarize the contents of a file.
Which means we can use them as an id for our service discovery strategy.

Build on the solution to exercise 4, but use file hashes as a way to identify
channels for service discovery. Also, instead of sharing its own source code
it should accept the filename as an argument.
